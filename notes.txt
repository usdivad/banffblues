FEATURES NEEDed:
- color following bar#
- timbre.js playback (maybe just metro for now? but still try to encode in the chord)
	- chords
	- metronome counting in between
- maybe make it more a composition indeed?
- bpm changer

TODO (GEN):
- different keys
- "suggested rhythmic groupings" clippy
- allow change form
- diff timbres?

TODO (SPEC):
- playback.js: Engine.playChord(): make the noteOffs one by one, not just blanket all; and a more robust system so that it doesn't get cut off by the last timeout
