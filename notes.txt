FEATURES NEEDed:
- color following bar#
- timbre.js playback (maybe just metro for now? but still try to encode in the chord)
	- chords
	- metronome counting in between
- maybe make it more a composition indeed?
- bpm changer

TODO (FEATURES):
- different keys
- "suggested rhythmic groupings" clippy
	- e.g. right now for chords in between bars... can't
- allow change form
- diff timbres?
- randomize octaves
- make playback more dynamic
	- e.g. live bpm button, that requires you checking it everytime the bpm is set etc.

TODO (ORG):
- playback.js: Engine.playChord(): make the noteOffs one by one, not just blanket all; and a more robust system so that it doesn't get cut off by the last timeout

- separate bar.js and playback.js
	- in particular, playBeat() should go into playback

- get rid of all the "t."s e.g. in playBeat()

- use php to generate the divs

- css get .row properly working
